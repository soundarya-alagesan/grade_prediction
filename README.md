# grade_prediction
The goal here is to predict the final grades of each student based on the features given. So, initially I read the dataset by using pandas and dropped the unimportant features based on the feature importance calculation. Then I coverted the categorical dataset to numerical, by label encoding. And here I used three classifiers primiraly,based on the dataset that are decisiontree,support vector machine and logistic regression.The accuracy rate for each of the classifier is calculated individually. And finally based on the accuracy rate calculated 'decisiontree classifier' has higher accuracy rate ,than the rest of the two in predicting the student's final grade.
